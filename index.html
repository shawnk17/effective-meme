                        <p>Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about! When will
                            I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom  a bottle, they're on TV! Yes! I am a
                            citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes!</strong>
                            <em> No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it.</em> I hope this
                            has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn.</p>

            <h1>Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.</h1>
            <p>Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box… This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story."</p>
            <p>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. <strong> Religion.</strong> <em> Friendship.</em> These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.</p>
            <h2>Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.</h2>
            <p>Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner.</li><li>Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk.</li><li>Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark.</li>

            <h3>Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work.</h3>
            <p>I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2.</li><li>Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems.</li><li>Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows. When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he's holding a gun. I didn't get rich by signing checks.</p>
            <p>Thank you, steal again. Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot. I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes!</p>
            <p>What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?</p>

            <p>I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.</p>
            <p>I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2. He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos.</p>
            <p>And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold. This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story."</p>

            <p>Save me, Jeebus. Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son." Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico?</p>
            <p>How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. …And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.</p>
            <p>Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman! Inflammable means flammable? What a country.</p>
