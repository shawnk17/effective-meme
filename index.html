                        <h1>Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry?</h1>
                        <p>Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about! When will
                            I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom  a bottle, they're on TV! Yes! I am a
                            citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes!</strong>
                            <em> No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it.</em> I hope this
                            has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn.</p>

            <h1>Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.</h1>
            <p>Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box… This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story."</p>
            <p>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. <strong> Religion.</strong> <em> Friendship.</em> These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.</p>
            <h2>Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.</h2>
            <p>Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.</p>
                        
            <p>I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows. When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he's holding a gun. I didn't get rich by signing checks.</p>
            <p>Thank you, steal again. Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot. I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes!</p>
            <p>What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?</p>
